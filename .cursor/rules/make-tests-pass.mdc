### ðŸŸ¢ **Make Tests Pass Rule**

After writing initial failing tests for any task with explicitly confirmed requirements:

1. **Minimal Implementation:**  
   _Write only enough code to pass your current failing tests._

2. **Incremental Focus:**  
   _Implement the simplest solution first; defer additional complexity._

3. **Strict Test Alignment:**  
   _Ensure code aligns exactly with test-defined behavior and requirements._

4. **Maintain Consistency:**  
   _Adhere to existing project patterns and coding standards ([eslint.config.js](mdc:eslint.config.js), [tsconfig.jest.json](mdc:tsconfig.jest.json))._
