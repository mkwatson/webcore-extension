### ðŸ§¹ **Refactor and Improve Rule**

After passing tests for any task with explicitly confirmed requirements:

1. **Simplify for Clarity:**
   _Refactor code to maximize readability and clearly communicate intent._

2. **Eliminate Duplication:**
   _Combine or abstract repeated code into reusable functions or modules._

3. **Enhance Maintainability:**
   _Align code structure with project patterns and standards ([eslint.config.js](mdc:eslint.config.js), [tsconfig.jest.json](mdc:tsconfig.jest.json)). Run the linter and type checker and fix all errors and warnings._

4. **Avoid Behavior Changes:**
   _Ensure existing tests remain green to verify no behavior regressions occur during refactoring._

5. **Verify Continuous Alignment:**
   _Regularly confirm refactored code matches original requirements._
