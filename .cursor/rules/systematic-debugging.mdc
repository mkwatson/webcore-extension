### ðŸ”§ **Systematic Debugging Rule**

When encountering issues, test failures, or unexpected implementation behavior:

1. **Pause and Restate Clearly:**  
   _Explicitly restate the exact issue or unexpected behavior._

2. **List Potential Root Causes:**  
   _Clearly list possible underlying reasons (assumptions, logic errors, integration issues)._

3. **Identify Helpful Documentation:**  
   _Explicitly name relevant documentation you think may assist. Request this documentation if unavailable._

4. **Prioritize and Address One Issue at a Time:**  
   _Prioritize root causes by likelihood, simplicity, and dependency order, then address each explicitly and individually._

5. **Explicitly Verify Hypotheses:**  
   _Clearly explain how you'll verify each hypothesis before implementing fixes._

6. **Propose Focused Solutions:**  
   _After verifying a root cause, propose minimal, targeted changes to directly resolve it._
