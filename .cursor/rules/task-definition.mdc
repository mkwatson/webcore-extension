### ðŸŽ¯ **Explicit Task Definition Rule**

For each clearly scoped task, explicitly confirm the requirements before coding.

1. **Restate & Confirm Requirements:**  
   _Explicitly restate the task to confirm accurate understanding._

2. **Clarify Ambiguities & Assumptions:**  
   _Clearly list uncertainties and explicitly ask clarifying questions._

3. **Identify Context & Edge Cases:**  
   _Mention relevant existing code, patterns, or documentation, and highlight any unusual scenarios or inputs._
