### ðŸ§ª **Write Tests First Rule**

For any clearly scoped task with explicitly confirmed requirements, strictly follow these steps:

1. **Restate Expected Behavior:**  
   _Explicitly restate the exact behavior your tests will verify._

2. **Review Existing Tests & Standards:**  
   _Examine existing tests to avoid redundancy and ensure consistency with project patterns._

3. **Define Focused Test Cases:**  
   _Clearly list test cases covering typical scenarios, edge cases, and error conditions. Avoid tests that don't drive new behaviors or meaningful implementation._

4. **Write Minimal Tests:**  
   _Create concise, behavior-focused tests without assuming implementation details._

5. **Verify Alignment:**  
   _Confirm tests precisely match stated requirements and relevant context._

6. **Follow Project Standards:**  
   _Ensure compliance with @jest.config.js, @eslint.config.js, @tsconfig.json, and @tsconfig.jest.json._
