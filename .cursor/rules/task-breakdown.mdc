### 🗂️ **Task Breakdown Rule**

Upon receiving an unclear or complex task, explicitly break it into manageable subtasks before defining detailed requirements.

1. **List Subtasks Explicitly:**  
   _Clearly separate the main task into actionable subtasks._

2. **Define Scope & Boundaries:**  
   _Explicitly state what's included and what's excluded._

3. **Identify Dependencies:**  
   _Highlight dependencies between subtasks and existing components._

4. **Confirm Task Granularity:**  
   _Ensure each subtask is implementation-ready and sufficiently small._
