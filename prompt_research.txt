Prompt Engineering for Page Summarization & Q&A Chrome Extension (MVP)

System Prompt: Grounding GPT-4 for Content Analysis

Begin with a system message that clearly defines the assistant’s role and constraints. This primes GPT-4 to focus on the provided page content and follow the desired style for both summarization and Q&A. Key points for an effective system prompt:
	•	Establish Role & Scope: Instruct the model that it is a content analysis assistant built into a browser extension. For example, “You are an AI assistant that analyzes webpage content (articles, PDFs, transcripts) and helps summarize it or answer questions about it for the user.” This frames GPT-4’s purpose and the types of inputs it will handle.
	•	Ground to Provided Content: Emphasize that all answers must be based solely on the page’s content, not external knowledge, to avoid hallucinations. For instance: “Use only the information from the given page content. Do not assume facts not in the text.” OpenAI notes that providing source text makes the model less likely to confabulate information ￼. This instruction ensures the model stays factual and relevant.
	•	Clarity and Tone Guidelines: The system prompt can also set the expected tone (helpful, concise, and neutral) and ask the model to explain or cite from the text when appropriate. e.g., “Explain concepts clearly, and maintain a neutral tone. If the user asks a question, reference the page content (e.g. ‘The article states…’) as needed.”
	•	Consistent Behavior: By consolidating these rules in the system message, you ensure they apply to every query. A developer on the OpenAI forum suggests putting all such instructions in the system role, with the user message containing the specific content or question ￼. This way, you can “load in” the rules once and then feed different page contents and requests in user prompts, and GPT-4 will consistently follow the guidelines.

🔸 Example System Prompt:

[System role instructions]  
You are a helpful browsing assistant that can summarize webpage content and answer questions about it.  
- Only use the information from the user-provided page text; do not add facts from elsewhere.  
- Provide clear, concise, and correct answers or summaries.  
- If you are unsure or the answer is not in the text, say you don’t have that information.  
- Stay objective and factual in your responses.  

This template grounds the model in the task (content analysis) and sets boundaries (no outside info, admit if something isn’t in the text), which is crucial for robustness and preventing irrelevant or hallucinated answers.

Summary Prompt Strategies

When the user clicks the “Summary” button, the extension should send GPT-4 a prompt that succinctly asks for a summary of the page’s content. Here are best practices for crafting this prompt:
	•	Be Clear and Specific: A good summarization prompt doesn’t just say “Summarize this.” It’s helpful to specify the desired focus or format ￼. For example, indicate if we want a brief overview, key points, or a certain format (bullet points vs. paragraph). In an MVP, a concise general instruction works well: e.g., “Summarize the following text in a few sentences, focusing on the main points and conclusions.” This tells GPT-4 exactly what outcome we expect (a short summary of key ideas) ￼.
	•	Conciseness and Length Hints: Emphasize that the summary should be brief but comprehensive. You might add a guideline like “in one paragraph” or “in 3-5 bullet points” to control length. For instance: “Provide a 5-sentence summary highlighting the article’s key arguments and findings.” By giving a length or format, you ensure the summary is neither too verbose nor too sparse ￼.
	•	Content-Type Cues (Optional): GPT-4 is generally adept at summarizing any text, but you can improve relevance by tailoring the prompt if you know the content type. In an MVP, this might be as simple as detecting the source or structure of the content and tweaking wording:
	•	If it’s a YouTube transcript: Include that context. “Summarize the following video transcript, capturing the main topics discussed.” This helps the model ignore filler dialogue and focus on substantive points.
	•	If it’s a PDF research paper: You might ask for important findings. “Summarize the academic paper below, focusing on its hypothesis, methodology, and conclusions.”
	•	If it’s a news article or blog post: A generic prompt is fine, or mention any obvious sections (e.g., “summarize this news article’s main story”).
These variations aren’t strictly required for a basic MVP, but they can make summaries more accurate for different genres. The extension can infer type from clues (file extension, domain, presence of timestamps or references) and adjust the wording accordingly. For example, many short lines or timestamps suggest a transcript, whereas headings like “Abstract, Introduction” suggest an academic paper. Even without these cues, GPT-4 will usually produce a decent summary, but a slight nudge can align the output with user expectations.
	•	Example Summary Prompt: When sending the request to GPT-4 for summarization, you might structure the user message like:

Please summarize the following text from a web page. The summary should be concise and cover the key points clearly for a general reader. 

""" 
[Page content goes here...] 
""" 

This prompt explicitly asks for a concise summary and provides the page content in quotes or a block for the model to read. The triple quotes (or a clear delimiter) help GPT-4 distinguish the page text from the instructions. The model, guided by the system prompt and this clear request, will generate a short overview of the content.

Why keep it simple? In an MVP, a single well-crafted prompt can handle most cases. GPT-4’s strength is understanding context and producing coherent summaries, so a straightforward instruction often suffices. You generally do not need lengthy role-play or complex chains of prompts for a basic summary. However, as a future enhancement, you could incorporate more advanced prompting (e.g. “step-by-step summarize then refine”) if needed for very complex documents ￼ ￼. Initially, brevity and clarity in the prompt will yield the best performance.

Chat Interface: Structuring Q&A Prompts

The chat interface allows the user to ask arbitrary questions about the page content, so the prompts must provide GPT-4 with enough context to answer accurately while preserving conversational flow. Key strategies:
	•	Include Relevant Page Context: For each user question, the extension should supply the page content (or a portion of it) along with the query. GPT-4 needs this to ground its answer. The simplest approach is to include the entire page text in the initial conversation (if it fits in the model’s context window) and keep it available throughout the chat. For example, the first user message could be the page content, or you prepend the content in each query. However, sending the full content every time can be inefficient if the text is very large. A more optimized approach is to include either a summary of the page or the most relevant excerpt for the question at hand.
	•	Prompt Template for Q&A: You want a format that clearly separates the content and the question. One effective pattern is:

[User message]  
Here is the page text:  
"""  
[Page content or excerpt]  
"""  

**Question:** Given this content, [user’s question]?  

This structure labels the content and the question explicitly. The system prompt has already instructed the model to use this content for answers, so now the user message just provides the actual text and query. By prefacing the question with “Given this content,” or a similar phrase, you remind GPT-4 to stick to the provided material. The assistant’s answer should then directly reference the page information (e.g., “According to the article, …”). This helps maintain relevance.

	•	Maintaining Conversational Context: GPT-4 can remember prior turns up to its context limit, so the conversation can flow naturally. The system message (with the grounding instructions) remains in effect, and the page content can be re-inserted or referenced as needed. For example, if the content is short enough, you might include it only once at the start; GPT-4 will recall details for a few turns. For longer chats or very large content, it’s safer to keep a summary or allow retrieval of specific parts (see next section) so that the model doesn’t lose track of details. In essence, treat the page content as a knowledge base that’s always “in the room” during the chat.
	•	Avoiding Hallucinations and Irrelevance: Apart from providing the source text, instruct the model (via system prompt or as a reminder in user prompt) not to answer from speculation. For instance: “If the question isn’t answered in the text, say you’re not sure or that the information isn’t in the page.” This way, if a user asks something unrelated or beyond the page (e.g. “What is the author’s birthdate?” when it’s not in the article), the assistant will respond that the info isn’t available, rather than making something up. Keeping the model “honest” in this manner is crucial for user trust. (This instruction is part of the system grounding, but it can be gently reinforced if needed in the user prompt for critical queries.)
	•	Example Q&A Interaction:
	•	System: [as above, with rules to use only page content]
	•	User (message 1): “Here is the text of the page I’m looking at:” [full page content]
	•	Assistant (message 1): (The assistant might not need to say anything yet, or could reply “Content received.” This step could also be done behind-the-scenes without a visible reply.)
	•	User (message 2): “What are the main arguments made in this article?”
	•	Assistant (message 2): “The article’s main arguments are that … [summarizes arguments based on content] …”
	•	User (message 3): “Who is the intended audience?”
	•	Assistant (message 3): “The content suggests the intended audience is … because the text says …”
In this example, the assistant uses details from the provided text to answer each question. The system prompt ensures it remains on-topic and truthful. Also, note that after the content is provided once, the assistant can reuse that context for subsequent questions. The extension could choose to resend the content or rely on the model’s memory; if the conversation is short, GPT-4 will typically remember the page details. For longer conversations, consider re-supplying a summary of the content or relevant excerpts to keep them fresh in context (since the model’s memory of the earliest message will fade as the token count grows) ￼.
	•	Keep Format User-Friendly: The chat answers should be in natural language, not just raw text extractions. GPT-4 is very good at rephrasing information in a helpful way. Your prompts can encourage this by phrasing questions naturally (“What does the author conclude about X?” instead of “Extract conclusion about X”). The system prompt’s tone instructions (e.g. clear and helpful) will also guide the style. By structuring the input well and grounding it, you let GPT-4 leverage its strengths in understanding context and producing fluent answers.

Handling Large Content Gracefully (Chunking & Summarization)

One of the biggest challenges is when a page’s content is longer than GPT-4’s context window (which might be 8K tokens by default – roughly ~6,000-6,500 words – or up to 32K tokens in extended versions). GPT-4 can’t ingest more text than its limit at once, so we need strategies to deal with very large inputs:
	•	1. Summarization or Pre-Processing Large Text: If the content is extremely long (e.g. a book chapter, lengthy report, or a full transcript), perform an initial condensation. A common approach is the “Map-Reduce” summarization technique ￼: break the text into chunks, summarize each chunk, and then summarize those summaries into a coherent final summary. This two-tier approach ensures even very large documents can be distilled. For example: Split a 50-page PDF into 5-page chunks, ask GPT-4 to summarize each chunk, then feed those chunk summaries back in (possibly to GPT-4 or even GPT-3.5 to save cost) with a prompt like “Combine these into a single summary of the entire document.” This yields an overall summary small enough for the model to handle ￼. The extension can do this behind the scenes when the “Summary” button is clicked on a huge document. The resulting summary (or an outline) can then serve as the basis for the final output. Keep in mind that each intermediate summarization should preserve key names, dates, stats, or other details if those might be asked about later. You might instruct GPT-4 during chunk summarization: “Include important proper nouns or data points in the summary.” This way, the final summary still contains reference points the user might query.
	•	2. Chunking for Q&A (Retrieval-Augmented Chat): For interactive questioning on large content, it’s inefficient and often impossible to stuff the entire text into each prompt. Instead, implement a chunk + retrieve strategy using embeddings or keyword search. In practice, this means:
a. Split the content into semantically coherent chunks (for example, paragraph by paragraph or ~500-token chunks that don’t cut off mid-sentence). It’s important that each chunk “makes sense” on its own ￼ ￼ – random splits can confuse the model ￼.
b. Embed each chunk as a vector (using a model like text-embedding-ada-002 from OpenAI). This converts each chunk into a mathematical representation of its meaning. Store these vectors in memory.
c. When the user asks a question, embed the question the same way and find the most similar content chunks (e.g. using cosine similarity search in the vector space).
d. Construct the prompt with the top relevant chunks only: e.g., “Refer to the following excerpts to answer the question… [insert 2-3 most relevant chunks] … Question: [user’s question].” By doing this, you feed GPT-4 just the portions of the text that are likely to contain the answer, staying well within the context limit. This method is known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and is a proven best practice for large documents ￼. It dramatically reduces the chance of the model drifting off-topic, since it has the exact snippets needed. Yaser Marey describes this approach: splitting the knowledge base into chunks, embedding them, and then providing the relevant chunks to the model will diminish hallucinations and keep answers grounded in the source ￼.
e. If the user then asks a follow-up question, repeat the retrieval with the new question to get relevant text. This ensures each answer is based on the right part of the document without overflowing the token limit.
Note: In an MVP, you might not build a full vector database, but even a simple keyword search through chunks or using GPT-4 itself to identify which chunk is relevant can work. For example, you could split the article and prepend each part with a heading, then ask GPT-4, “Which section(s) likely contain information about [user question]? Here are the sections: [list of short summaries or titles].” Once you know the section, provide that section’s text in the prompt for the answer. This is a simpler fallback if implementing embeddings is too heavy initially. The goal is to narrow the context to what’s needed for each query, improving both performance (faster responses, fewer tokens sent) and accuracy.
	•	3. Leverage GPT-4’s Context Window Wisely: If you have access to GPT-4’s 32K context model (or larger, as they evolve), you can sometimes feed very large content in one go. For instance, 32K tokens is ~50 pages of text ￼, which might cover many web articles or moderate PDF files. However, even with a huge context, stuffing it to the brim isn’t always ideal – very long prompts can lead to the model losing focus or taking longer to respond ￼ ￼. It can also be expensive in API usage. Best practice is still to be selective with context: if only part of the page is relevant to the user’s question, try to include just that part. Use summaries or retrieval to condense irrelevant sections. In other words, more context window is a tool, not an excuse to always send the maximum text ￼. A balanced approach (some upfront summarization, some retrieval) often yields the most reliable answers and keeps the system efficient.
	•	4. Progressive Summarization in Chat: If the user engages in a long session asking many detailed questions about different parts of a lengthy text, you might dynamically adjust context. For example, if certain sections have been discussed at length, you could keep a running summary of the conversation or the section that was covered. Then if the user’s questions shift to a new section, retrieve that new section’s text. If they come back to an old topic after many turns, you might reinsert the summary of that section as a reminder. Essentially, treat it like you have multiple “chunks” of context: the page content chunks and a conversation history summary. Keeping these updated helps maintain context without re-sending everything every time ￼. This is a more advanced technique and might be overkill for an MVP, but it’s good to be aware of as you scale.

Performance considerations: By handling large content with summarization and chunking, you ensure the prompts stay within GPT-4’s limits and responses stay snappy. This is crucial for a good user experience. It’s often faster (and cheaper) to let GPT-4 work on a distilled version of the text than to prompt it with thousands of extra tokens of raw data. Moreover, these strategies enhance clarity – the model is less likely to get “distracted” by irrelevant paragraphs if you’ve filtered to the important parts.

Conclusion and Template Summary

In summary, structuring your prompts thoughtfully will make the Chrome extension both accurate and user-friendly:
	•	Use a strong system prompt to define the assistant’s role (web page analyzer) and rules (use only given content, be concise and factual). This global instruction set grounds GPT-4 for all interactions ￼.
	•	For the summary feature, keep the user prompt straightforward (e.g. “Summarize the following…”) with possibly minor tweaks if you detect specific content types. Aim for clear intent and brevity in the prompt to leverage GPT-4’s summarization strengths ￼.
	•	For the Q&A chat, always include context (full text, summary, or snippets) with the question. Structure the prompt so that it’s obvious what is content vs. what is the question. This helps GPT-4 maintain context and accuracy through the conversation. Remind it to stick to the content, which avoids off-base answers ￼.
	•	Handle long content by breaking it down: use multi-step summarization for overlong texts ￼, or embed and retrieve relevant chunks for targeted questions ￼. This keeps the model’s input within workable limits and focuses its attention appropriately. Even in an MVP, a simple form of chunking (like splitting and summarizing) can dramatically improve robustness with minimal complexity.

Finally, always test your prompts with a variety of pages (articles, PDFs, videos) to see if GPT-4’s responses are accurate and concise. Iterate on wording as needed – small changes in instructions can have outsized effects on quality. By following these best practices, you’ll harness GPT-4’s strengths (its understanding of context and nuance) while mitigating its limitations (fixed context size and tendency to improvise). The result will be a clear, reliable summary at the press of a button, and a responsive Q&A experience that feels truly grounded in the page the user is viewing.
