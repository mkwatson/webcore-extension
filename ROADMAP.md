# WebCore Extension Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned improvements to our Chrome extension development process, ordered by priority and implementation timeline.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current Focus)

Our immediate focus is on establishing the fundamental infrastructure needed for efficient development and release management.

### High Priority (Now)

1. **Semantic Versioning Setup**
   - Add version management script to update manifest.json and package.json in sync
   - Configure commitlint for standardized commit messages (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
   - Enforce version increments based on commit type (major/minor/patch)

2. **Enhanced GitHub Actions Workflow**
   - Auto-create GitHub releases when version changes
   - Attach built extension ZIP to releases
   - Generate proper release notes from commits
   - Streamline the release process

3. **Basic Testing Framework**
   - Set up Jest or similar for unit testing core functionality
   - Implement simple tests for critical functions
   - Include testing in CI pipeline to catch regressions early

4. **Improved Development Experience**
   - Add hot-reloading for faster development cycles
   - Create dev/build mode distinctions
   - Configure sourcemaps for easier debugging

5. **Code Quality Tools**
   - Add ESLint/Prettier for code style enforcement
   - Implement TypeScript strict mode for better type safety
   - Add pre-commit hooks to enforce standards

## Phase 2: Scaling (As Project Grows)

As the extension gains functionality and users, we'll implement more sophisticated workflows.

### Medium Priority

6. **Branching Strategy Implementation**
   - Configure protected branches
   - Document PR review requirements
   - Set up automatic PR labeling

7. **Environment Configuration**
   - Create development/staging/production environments
   - Add environment-specific settings
   - Configure feature flags system for controlled rollouts

8. **Documentation Framework**
   - Set up automated JSDoc/TSDoc generation
   - Create user-facing documentation
   - Implement auto-updated changelog

9. **Advanced Testing**
   - Add browser integration tests
   - Implement user flow testing
   - Add visual regression tests

10. **Security Scanning**
    - Configure Dependabot for dependency updates
    - Add security scanning for vulnerabilities
    - Implement secret detection

## Phase 3: Optimization (Future)

These improvements will be considered as the project matures and user base grows.

### Lower Priority

11. **Monitoring Integration**
    - Set up error tracking (Sentry)
    - Add performance monitoring
    - Implement usage analytics

12. **Chrome Web Store Integration**
    - Automate store submissions via API
    - Set up beta channel publishing
    - Configure staged rollouts

13. **Containerized Development**
    - Create Docker development environment
    - Standardize developer onboarding
    - Configure VS Code devcontainers

14. **Advanced CI/CD Features**
    - Matrix testing across browsers/versions
    - Parallel job execution
    - Performance benchmarking

15. **Contributor Tools**
    - Add issue templates
    - Create contributing guidelines
    - Set up automated first-issue labeling

## Release Strategy

### GitHub Releases

We'll create GitHub releases when:
- Completing significant new features
- Fixing important bugs
- Making meaningful version increments following semantic versioning:
  - **Major** (1.0.0 → 2.0.0): Breaking changes
  - **Minor** (1.1.0 → 1.2.0): New features, backward compatible
  - **Patch** (1.1.1 → 1.1.2): Bug fixes, backward compatible

### Chrome Web Store Publishing

We'll publish to the Chrome Web Store when:
- We have user-facing changes providing clear value
- All changes have been properly tested
- The code is production-ready and stable
- Documentation and store listings are updated

Our goal is to balance release frequency to maintain momentum without overwhelming users with constant updates.

## Success Metrics

We'll measure success of this development workflow by:
- Reduction in development time
- Faster iteration and feedback cycles
- Fewer bugs reaching production
- Consistent release quality
- Positive user feedback
