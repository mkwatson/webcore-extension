# WebCore Extension Project Tasks

## Overview
A Chrome extension that provides an AI-powered chat interface for discussing webpage contents. The extension extracts page content, converts it to markdown, and enables users to have contextual conversations about the page using LLM technology.

  - [x] Fixed service worker global context references (window vs self)
  - [x] Made code context-aware for different extension environments
  - [x] Implemented cross-context communication patterns

### 6. Technical Debt & Production Considerations

- [ ] 6.1. Module Bundling
  - [ ] Evaluate webpack/rollup for proper ES module bundling
  - [ ] Implement proper asset pipeline for production builds
  - [ ] Set up tree-shaking and code splitting

- [ ] 6.2. Architecture Improvements
  - [ ] Replace current global object pattern with proper module system
  - [ ] Implement dependency injection for better testability

## Progress Tracking

### Current Status
ðŸŸ¡ Project Setup Complete
ðŸŸ¡ Basic Extension Framework Working
âšª Feature Development In Progress

### Next Steps
1. Begin with UI components implementation
2. Set up content extraction pipeline
3. Integrate LLM functionality

### Notes
- All tasks should be tested thoroughly before marking as complete
- Security considerations should be reviewed for each component
- Performance impact should be monitored throughout development

## Dependencies
- React
- OpenAI API
- Chrome Extension APIs
- HTML-to-Markdown converter (TBD)

## Debugging Notes

### Extension Loading Issues Resolved

We encountered and resolved two major technical challenges:

1. **ES Module Import/Export Syntax Incompatibility**
   - **Problem**: Service worker registration failed (Status code 3) and content scripts had errors: "Cannot use import statement outside a module"
   - **Solution**: Removed ES module syntax and adopted more traditional export patterns with global objects
   - **Long-term Options**: 
     - Implement proper module bundling with webpack or rollup
     - Use IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions) for scoping
     - Configure a proper TypeScript compilation pipeline with optimal settings for extensions

2. **Service Worker Context Issues**
   - **Problem**: "Uncaught ReferenceError: window is not defined" in service worker
   - **Solution**: Made code context-aware by detecting the environment (window vs self) and using the appropriate global object
   - **Long-term Options**:
     - Create environment abstractions to handle different contexts
     - Use a specialized framework designed for extensions (e.g., Plasmo)
     - Implement better dependency injection to avoid global object references

The temporary solution uses a simplified architecture that makes objects globally available in both window and service worker contexts, avoiding ES module syntax. This approach enables faster debugging but should be replaced with a more robust architecture for production.
