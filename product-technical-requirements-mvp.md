# üöÄ WebCore - AI for the Web

> **Bringing AI assistance directly into the browser, where users already spend their time.**

# Project Planning Document

## üéØ Product Overview & Goals

**Problem Statement:**  
Web users need seamless AI assistance within their browsing context - for summarizing content, asking questions, and interacting with web pages - without switching to external tools or interfaces.

**Vision:**  
This project is to Chrome what Cursor is to VS Code - bringing AI assistance directly into the browsing environment where users already spend their time, rather than forcing them to use yet another separate chat interface.

**Target Users:**  
Early adopters who regularly consume long-form web content and benefit from quick summaries and follow-up interactions.

**Goals:**  
- Quickly release an MVP to real users (speed over completeness).
- Capture initial feedback and rapidly iterate.
- Validate the core value proposition: in-browser AI assistance.

## üß† User Scenarios

These scenarios demonstrate how WebCore transforms the browsing experience:

### Scenario 1: The Academic Researcher
**Sarah** is a graduate student researching neural networks across multiple technical articles. With WebCore:
- She clicks the WebCore icon as each page loads
- With one click, she gets a concise summary highlighting key concepts
- She asks follow-up questions like "Explain backpropagation in simpler terms"
- She continues to the next article without losing context or switching apps
- She saves approximately 40% of her research time and maintains better comprehension

### Scenario 2: The News Consumer
**Marcus** wants to stay informed but struggles with information overload. With WebCore:
- He browses his usual news sites and activates WebCore
- The extension summarizes lengthy articles into key points
- For complex topics, he asks clarifying questions directly in the sidebar
- When articles reference unfamiliar concepts, he asks WebCore for explanations
- He absorbs more information in less time without opening multiple tabs or search engines

### Scenario 3: The Online Shopper
**Priya** is researching a major purchase decision by comparing product reviews. With WebCore:
- She opens multiple reviews of competing products
- WebCore summarizes each review, highlighting pros and cons
- She asks specific questions about features that matter to her
- She makes a more confident purchase decision without manually taking notes
- Her decision-making process is more efficient and thorough

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Planning

### Tech Stack:
- **Monorepo:** `pnpm` Workspaces
- **Frontend:** Plasmo Chrome Extension + React + TypeScript
- **Backend:** Vercel Serverless Functions + TypeScript
- **Auth:** Firebase Auth (Google OAuth) with Chrome Identity API
- **AI:** OpenAI API (initial MVP)
- **Linting/Quality Control:** ESLint, Prettier, Strict TypeScript
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions for linting, type checks, and deployment

### Content Extraction Strategy:
- Use extension content scripts to access page DOM directly (avoids CORS issues)
- Process content with Readability.js to identify main content
- Convert to clean markdown using Turndown or similar library
- Include metadata (title, URL, date) as structured context
- Simple truncation for content exceeding token limits with user notification

### API Design Rationale:
This API design follows a simplified version of the OpenAI Chat API pattern for several key reasons:
- **Simplicity**: Minimal implementation effort for both frontend and backend
- **Familiarity**: Leverages widely-understood LLM chat patterns
- **Flexibility**: Supports general chat functionality beyond just summarization
- **Statelessness**: Can be implemented without server-side conversation storage for MVP
- **Extensibility**: Can evolve to add model selection, temperature controls, etc.

The primary goal is maximum capability with minimal complexity for rapid MVP development.

### API Contract (OpenAI-Style Pass-Through):
```json
POST /api/chat
Request:
{
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Summarize this page: [content]"},
    // Additional messages in conversation history (for follow-ups)
  ],
  "context": {
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "title": "Optional page title"
  }
}

Response:
{
  "message": {
    "role": "assistant",
    "content": "Generated response text"
  },
  "conversation_id": "conv_123" // Optional, for client reference
}

Response Error (400/500):
{
  "error": "Simple error message"
}
```

### Implementation Notes:
- **API Versioning**: Not needed for MVP (single client/server deployment)
- **Rate Limiting**: Initially rely on OpenAI account spending cap and usage monitoring
- **Token Limits**: Simple truncation from beginning of document for MVP
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with Chrome Identity API for secure OAuth flow
- **CORS Handling**: Direct DOM access via extension content scripts

### Error Handling & Edge Cases:
- **Auth Errors:** Redirect clearly back to Firebase OAuth login.
- **API/Network Errors:** Explicit, simple message to retry.
- **Content Too Long:** Notify user when content is truncated.
- **API Limits:** Monitor usage but no hard limits for initial release.
